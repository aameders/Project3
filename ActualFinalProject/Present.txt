- Beginning of code is the same search bar and navigation as rest
- Footer is the same
- Spacing is crucial to this page done auto with col conatiner
	- Done with col-md-10 code
	- Col specifies the following code is in a coloum 
	- next bit is how small the window can get before the thing is moved down and stacked (md = medium)
	- next bit is how many "spaces" the thing occupies, 12 spaces are in a coloum
- col-md-10 puts the following code into one coloum that takes up 10 "spaces" leaving 1 space on either side
	- All of the code falls in this div so spacing is consistent
- alert alert-warning = class alert is the colored text box and the style is "warning" which only affects color
- row class called to put thumbnails next to each other
- col-sm-2 further divided into more colomnus and each size 2 * 6 = 12
- thumbnail in each col-sm-2 with img and then seperate caption 
	- caption had button (disabled) with glyphcon and badge displaying number
- row ends after 6 and new row is started
- Progress class for bar
	- call type then style "info" is color, role "progress bar", 
	- style width changes how full that portion represents 
	- aria value now = cur value min = min max = max
	- put what to call between div
