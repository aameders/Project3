Portrait of Fritza Riedler
1906

A painting embellished with gold and silver leaf, the geometric design of this work pulls the viewer away from
her body and the armchair and brings focus to her face. This is accomplished with the semicircular motif lying behind 
her head. The motif is thought of to have been inspired by Egyptian art and the works of Diego Velazquez.
