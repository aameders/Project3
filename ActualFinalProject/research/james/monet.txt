Claude Monet was the founder of Impressionism who rejected the prevailing theories taught to him by Marc Gleyre in Paris. 
The source of his innovation was treating a scene like a collection of colors and shapes instread of objects in a scene. 
His paintings are dynamic, and he broke color with intense contrast to display changes in light level.

Impressionism was opposed by the art community at large and was driven by Claude Monet and a group of like 
minded artists who faced rejection elsewhere. Their paintings were constructed using freely brushed contours and 
smooth lines that focused on portraying the overall scene instead of fine details. Impressionists used the method
of painting outside "en plein air" to capture the effects of weather and changing light levels. This contrasts with
 the academic techniques that took place inside studios which were usually staged in certain light conditions.
