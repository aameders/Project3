"Girl With A Pearl Earring" is an oil painting by Johannes Vermeer.
Going by various names over the centuries, it became known by its present 
title towards the end of the 20th century after the large pearl earring worn by 
the girl portrayed there. In 2006, the Dutch public selected it as the most 
beautiful painting in the Netherlands.
