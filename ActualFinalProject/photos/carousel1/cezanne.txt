The Card Players
1890-1892

On display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York

The Card Players is part of the Card Players series by Paul Cezanne. The 5 paintings in the series are all composed with 
a set of 5 people, 3 players and a young and old observer. He went on to leave out the young observer or the third player
from some of the paintings. This particular one has 3 players and no young observer. By eliminating excess detail the 
painting achieves a beautiful symmetry.

The Smoker
1890

This painting by Paul Cezanne is thought to portray aloofness from the everyday cares. There is less attention payed to 
the mans features in the portrait, and instead the form and colour are emphesized.
