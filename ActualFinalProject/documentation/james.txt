11-3-20 First meeting for the Project. We split the research burden between me and Addie
            While Grant agreed to handle the carousel. Addie has a copy of the assignment 
            from WebI that had 2 pages mostly done. We Imported that and split up all of
            the remaining work we anticipate

11-8-20 Started Research on chosen 5 artists: Monet, Matisse, Michelangelo, Klimpt, and Cezanne
            Gathered all works by said artists and tracked down the titles of the art works
